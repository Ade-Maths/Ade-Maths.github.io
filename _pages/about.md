I'm very interested in plant breeding, statistical and quantitative genetics and developing of real time models to nexus machine learning and crop improvement. I also love learning new things, meeting new friends, singing and listening to music (gospel songs). 
Feel free to contact me if you got interested in any of my research fields. Let's discuss some science!
